## Description

This project uses React and Vite, and was designed to learn about JavaScript Frameworks. I choose not to use a CSS Framework to get the full experience writing my styles in styled-components and CSS modules. The page is a online shop "selling" a variety of items. The task was to build the site, list all products, list single product, add product to cart and complete checkout. A contact form that logs the data in the console.
